## Phase 1: Requirements and Planning

**Objective & Direction:** Define **what** the web application will do and **who** will use it. This phase sets the project’s scope, features, and user roles. It provides a clear direction before any coding begins, ensuring that the solo developer (you) understands the end goals and necessary features.

**Key Activities:**

- **Gather Requirements:** List out all features and functionalities the platform needs (e.g. user authentication, job search, resume upload, AI-based job matching, etc.). Identify the different user roles (job seeker, recruiter/HR, administrator) and what each can do.
    
- **Define Scope:** Since this is a prototype with no strict deadline, prioritize core features first (MVP) and note optional nice-to-have features for later.
    
- **User Stories & Use Cases:** Write short descriptions of how each type of user will interact with the system. For example, “As a job seeker, I can search for jobs and upload my resume.”
    
- **Choose Technology Approach:** Confirm the tech stack and how components interact. Decide that the frontend will use **Next.js** (React + TypeScript) for each user interface, the backend will use **Nest.js** (Node + TypeScript) for APIs, **PostgreSQL** for the database, and **Python** for specialized services (web scraping and AI matching).
    
- **Document Everything:** Create a project plan document or notes with the above information. This will serve as a reference throughout development.
    

**Outputs (Files/Artifacts):**

- Project requirements documentation (e.g. a markdown file outlining features, user roles, and use cases).
    
- An initial architecture outline or simple diagram showing how frontend, backend, and Python services will interact.
    
- A rough timeline or plan (which this document fulfills) breaking the work into phases.
    

**File Structure & Key Files:**

At this stage, no code is written yet. You will mainly create a documentation folder to store planning docs:

- **`/docs/`** – (Folder) Contains all planning and design documents.
    
    - `requirements.md`: Detailed requirements, user roles, and feature list for the project.
        
    - `architecture.md`: High-level system architecture and module design (to be expanded in Phase 2).
        

These files clarify **what** you’re building and **how** you’ll approach it, serving as a blueprint for subsequent phases.
