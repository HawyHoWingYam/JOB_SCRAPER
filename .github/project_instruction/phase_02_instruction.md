## Phase 2: Architecture and Module Design

**Objective & Direction:** Design a **modular and scalable architecture** for both front-end and back-end before implementation. The goal is to break the system into logical modules and components, making the project easy to develop and extend. Focus on how to separate concerns (for example, distinct modules for different features or user types) and define how the parts (Next.js frontends, Nest.js backend, Python services) will communicate.

**Key Activities:**

- **Design Front-End Architecture:** Decide how to structure the Next.js front-end. Determine if you will have one Next.js project handling multiple user interfaces or separate Next.js projects for each role (e.g. one for clients, one for recruiters/HR portal, one for admin). Consider starting with a single Next.js codebase for simplicity, using role-based routes or sections, and ensure it can scale (you can later split into multiple front-end projects if needed).
    
- **Design Back-End Architecture:** Break down the Nest.js backend into **feature modules**. Determine the main modules (for example: Auth module for authentication, Users module for user profiles, Jobs module for job postings & search, Applications module for job applications, etc.). Also plan how to handle role-based access – possibly through separate controllers or services for each role or a unified approach with role checks (RBAC) in each module.
    
- **Define Data Models & Database Schema:** Outline the key data entities (e.g. User, Job, Application, Resume) and their relationships. Plan the database schema (tables for users, jobs, applications, etc. in PostgreSQL). Decide on using an ORM (like TypeORM or Prisma) or query builder for database access in Nest.js.
    
- **Plan Python Services Integration:** Architect how the Python components will fit in. For example, a **Crawler service** (for web scraping job listings) and an **AI Matching service** (for resume/job matching using NLP). Decide if these will be standalone scripts or microservices. Common approach: Python services run separately and communicate with the Nest.js backend via REST APIs or through the database (e.g. the crawler writes data to the DB directly, the Nest backend reads it).
    
- **Decide on Monorepo vs Multi-repo:** As a solo developer, a monorepo (single repository) is convenient for managing frontend, backend, and scripts together. Plan a top-level repository structure that contains sub-folders for front-end, back-end, and Python services. This way, you can share code (like type definitions or config) if needed and keep everything in sync.
    
- **Update Documentation:** Write an architecture design document (or update `architecture.md`) capturing decisions: module breakdown, component interactions, and how data flows between front-end, back-end, and services. Sketch out a simple diagram of the system’s high-level design if possible (e.g. Frontend -> Backend API -> Database; Backend -> calls to Python service; etc.).
    

**Outputs (Files/Artifacts):**

- **Architecture design document:** Expanded `docs/architecture.md` with the module structure for front-end and back-end, plus integration points with Python services.
    
- **Module list:** A clear list of front-end components/pages and back-end modules that will be implemented, possibly with brief responsibility descriptions for each.
    
- Optionally, an architecture diagram (as an image or diagram file) to visualize the system components.
    

**File Structure & Key Files (Design Stage):**

Still in design phase, but you can prepare the repository structure (empty folders or READMEs to be filled later) according to the plan:

- **`/frontend/`** – (Folder) Placeholder for Next.js frontend code. If planning multiple frontends, you might have `frontend-client/`, `frontend-portal/`, `frontend-admin/` instead. Currently, may contain a README describing the intended structure.
    
- **`/backend/`** – (Folder) Placeholder for Nest.js backend API code. Include a README outlining planned modules and maybe an initial `package.json` for the Node project.
    
- **`/services/`** – (Folder) For Python services. Inside this, plan sub-folders:
    
    - **`/services/crawler/`** – will contain the web scraping service (Python).
        
    - **`/services/ai_matching/`** – will contain the AI analysis/matching service (Python).
        

For now, these folders might be mostly empty or have design notes. The purpose is to have a **blueprint directory structure** so you know where each part of the project will live once you start coding. This modular separation (frontend vs backend vs services) ensures clarity and scalability from the get-go.
