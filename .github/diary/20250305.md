1. 
npm run check-updates to see what updates are available
npm run update-deps to update all dependencies to their latest versions





2. New Next.js file structure
- client-frontend/
├── app/
│   ├── providers.js
└── lib/
    └── store.js
- store.js is essential for managing complex application state in a maintainable way, particularly for a data-intensive application like your job scraper that will handle multiple data sources, filtering options, and user interactions.
- providers.js file is an architectural pattern that elegantly solves the challenge of using client-side libraries like Redux and Material-UI while maintaining the server component benefits in Next.js App Router. It's not just a convenience—it's a crucial part of the modern Next.js application structure that enables you to use advanced features without sacrificing performance or SEO capabilities.



5. Set up Material-UI
- npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material
@mui/material: The core Material-UI component library
@emotion/react & @emotion/styled: The styling engine used by MUI
@mui/icons-material: Material Design icons
- Create theme.js to configure Material-UI Theme Provider (defines a consistent design system for your job scraper application. This file will expand upon the basic theme configuration currently in your providers.js.)

- current js usage
Your layout.js is a server component that:
  .Sets up the Inter font
  .Provides metadata (title, description)
  .Imports the Providers wrapper component
  .Establishes the basic HTML structure

Your providers.js is a client component (marked with 'use client') that:
  .Sets up the Redux provider with your store
  .Implements the Material-UI ThemeProvider with your custom theme
  .Includes CssBaseline for consistent styling defaults

Your theme.js contains all the theme customizations:
  .Custom color palette with primary, secondary, and other colors
  .Typography settings with the Inter font
  .Component-specific styling overrides for cards, buttons, chips, etc.
  .Responsive breakpoints


6. Set up Redux
- npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux next-redux-wrapper
- lib/
└── store/
    ├── index.js        # Store configuration
    ├── slices/         # Redux slices (using Redux Toolkit)
    │   ├── jobsSlice.js
    │   ├── filtersSlice.js
    │   └── uiSlice.js
    └── middleware.js   # Custom middleware

- index.js Set Up Redux Store Configuration
- jobsSlice.js Create Sample Redux Slices for job listings
- filtersSlice.js a slice for filters
- uiSlice.js Create a UI slice for UI state
- update layout.js to include the Redux provider
- update page.js to use Redux

7. Search Function not work
- modify the fetchJobs in jobsSlice.js thunk to filter the data based on the search query
