# Frontend Development Planning for Job Scraper Project

## Understanding the Requirements

Start development on a job scraper application with multiple technology stacks, and begin with the frontend component first. Based on project structure, using:
- **Next.js** as the core framework
- **Material-UI** for component library and styling
- **Redux** for state management

This frontend will likely need to display scraped job listings, provide filtering capabilities, and offer user interaction with the collected data.

## Main Challenges and Considerations

1. **Data Representation**: Displaying potentially large sets of job listings efficiently
2. **UI/UX Design**: Creating an intuitive interface for job search and filtering
3. **State Management**: Handling complex application state for filters, pagination, and user preferences
4. **API Integration**: Preparing for eventual backend connection (Nest.js with GraphQL)
5. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the app remains responsive with large data sets

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Description**: Start with core components and one key feature, then expand both in parallel.

**Pros:**
- Balances immediate value delivery with sustainable architecture
- Allows for rapid prototyping while establishing good patterns
- Adapts well to emerging requirements

**Cons:**
- Requires careful planning and communication

## Recommended Implementation Plan

I recommend the Hybrid Approach with the following step-by-step implementation plan:

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Structure (1-2 days)

1. Initialize project with Create Next App or Vite
- Configure the basic app files
- Set up Material-UI
- Configure Redux
- Set up routing
2. Set up Material-UI theme and basic styling
3. Create folder structure following feature-based organization
4. Set up basic routing with Router
5. Implement basic state management (start with Context API, add Redux when needed)

### Phase 2: Core Components and First Feature (3-5 days)

1. Develop core reusable UI components:
   - Job card component
   - Search/filter components
   - Pagination component
   - Loading states and error handling

2. Implement the job listing feature:
   - Job listings page with mock data
   - Basic search and filtering
   - Responsive layout for different screen sizes

### Phase 3: Expand Features and Refine (5-7 days)

1. Add detailed job view
2. Implement advanced filtering and sorting
3. Add user preferences (saved jobs, etc.)
4. Prepare API integration points for backend

### Phase 4: Connect with Backend (When Backend Is Ready)

1. Integrate GraphQL client (Apollo)
2. Replace mock data with actual API calls
3. Implement proper error handling and loading states
4. Add authentication if needed

## Would you like me to provide more specific details on any aspect of this plan? For example:

- Detailed folder structure recommendation
- Specific component hierarchy
- Redux store organization
- Material-UI theming setup

What specific aspect of the frontend development would you like to focus on first?
