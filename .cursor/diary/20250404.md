# Centralized Web Scraping with Scheduled Tasks
1. **Faster Time-to-Market**: Enables quicker development of an MVP while providing a solid foundation
2. **Simpler Architecture**: Easier to develop, maintain, and debug
3. **Lower Initial Cost**: Reduced infrastructure and operational costs
4. **Scalability Path**: Can be incrementally enhanced toward the other solutions as needed

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Backend Infrastructure (Nest.js)

1. **Core Modules**:
   - `JobsModule`: Managing job listings, searches, and filters
   - `ScrapersModule`: Interface with Python scrapers
   - `UsersModule`: Optional - for user preferences and saved jobs
   - `SchedulerModule`: Managing scraper scheduling

2. **Database Schema**:
   - `jobs`: Store job listings with metadata
   - `companies`: Company information
   - `job_sources`: Track different job boards/sources
   - `scraper_logs`: Track scraping operations and errors

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/jobs`: CRUD operations for job listings
   - `/api/jobs/search`: Advanced search functionality
   - `/api/scraper/trigger`: Manual trigger for scraping jobs
   - `/api/scraper/status`: Check scraper status

### 2. Python Scraping Service

1. **Infrastructure**:
   - Create `python` directory in the project root
   - Set up Poetry for dependency management
   - Implement individual scrapers per job site

2. **Core Components**:
   - Base scraper class with common functionality
   - Site-specific scrapers inheriting from base
   - Data normalization and cleaning utilities
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Database connection layer

3. **Job Site Scrapers**:
   - Initial target: 3-5 major job boards (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor)
   - Implement proper rate limiting and anti-ban measures
   - Extract structured data with consistent schema

### 3. Frontend Development (Next.js)

1. **Core Pages**:
   - Home/Dashboard: Overview and quick search
   - Search Results: Filtered job listings
   - Job Detail: Comprehensive job information
   - Saved Jobs: Optionally, for registered users

2. **Components**:
   - JobCard: Summary view of job listings
   - SearchFilters: Advanced filtering options
   - JobDetails: Expanded job information
   - Pagination: For navigating through results

3. **State Management**:
   - Use React Query for data fetching and caching
   - Server Components for initial data loading
   - Client Components for interactive elements

### 4. Integration Layer

1. **Communication**:
   - REST API for frontend-backend communication
   - Database-based communication between Nest.js and Python
   - File-based configuration sharing

2. **Scheduling**:
   - Implement cron jobs for regular scraping
   - Stagger scraping times to avoid overloading
   - Implement backoff strategy for failed attempts

### 5. Deployment Strategy

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Docker Compose for local development
   - PostgreSQL in Docker container
   - Hot reloading for both frontend and backend

2. **Production Environment**:
   - Containerized deployment
   - Separate services for frontend, backend, and scrapers
   - Database backup and recovery strategy

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Setup Python Environment**:
   - Create directory structure for Python service
   - Set up Poetry and dependencies
   - Implement base scraper class

2. **Enhance Backend Structure**:
   - Create core modules in Nest.js
   - Set up database entities and migrations
   - Implement basic API endpoints

3. **Build Frontend Foundation**:
   - Create core pages and components
   - Implement responsive design with Tailwind
   - Set up API integration with React Query

4. **Implement First Scraper**:
   - Choose one job site for initial implementation
   - Build and test scraper for that site
   - Integrate with database


## Next Steps

After implementing these files, you'll have a basic Python scraper infrastructure that can:

1. Scrape job listings from Indeed
2. Parse and normalize job data
3. Store jobs in a PostgreSQL database
4. Provide a simple CLI interface for testing

To run this initial implementation:

1. Create the directory structure and files
2. Install Poetry (if not already installed)
3. Run `poetry install` in the `python` directory
4. Set up a PostgreSQL database named `job_scraper`
5. Run a test scrape with:
   ```
   poetry run python -m job_scraper --query "software engineer" --location "New York" --save
   ```

Once you've validated this basic scraper functionality, we can proceed to:

1. Implementing additional scrapers (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc.)
2. Creating the Nest.js API endpoints to trigger scraping and retrieve job data
3. Developing the Next.js frontend to display job listings
